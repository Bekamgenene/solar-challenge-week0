# Solar Challenge Week 0 – Solar Data Discovery

This repository contains the code and resources for the Solar Challenge Week 0 project, focused on end-to-end solar irradiance data analysis for Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bekamgenene/solar-challenge-week0.git
cd solar-challenge-week0
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

#### Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux/MacOS:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📝 Basic Usage

- Run exploratory data analysis notebooks from the `notebooks/` folder.
- To export cleaned data, use scripts/notebooks; **never commit raw or cleaned CSVs** (see `.gitignore`).
- Visualizations and summary tables are generated in Jupyter notebooks.
- To check CI status, look for runs triggered by updates to the repo (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## 📂 Recommended Folder Structure

├── src/                         # Source code (functions, business logic)
├── tests/                       # Unit and integration tests
├── scripts/                     # Data cleaning and processing scripts
├── data/                        # Data files (ignored by Git)
├── .gitignore                   # Ignore rules

```

## 🤖 Continuous Integration

This repository uses GitHub Actions. On each push or PR:
- Python packages are installed
- Tests are run (if available)
- Results are reported under the Actions tab

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for details.

## 📌 Repository Best Practices

- Comply with `.gitignore` rules: never commit `data/`, CSV files, or Python/IDE/autogenerated files.  
- Always use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `init: add .gitignore`, `ci: add workflow`, `docs: update setup steps`).
- Make changes on feature branches; use pull requests to merge into `main`.
- Include README documentation and update whenever setup changes.

## 📒 EDA Outline & Insights

See analysis notebooks in `notebooks/`.  
Each country has its own EDA notebook, covering data profiling, cleaning, and reporting.  
Cross-country comparison and summary findings are in `notebooks/compare_countries.ipynb`.
